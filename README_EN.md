# System Shell Box

## What is this?

**System Shell Box (SSB)** is a free and open-source file management tool inspired by MT Manager, but with core functionalities fully implemented via a terminal emulator.  
üì¶ This project aims to provide users with a **lightweight and extensible** alternative to MT Manager's paid features, without relying on closed-source components.

**Note**: This app is currently in early development and lacks many features.

## How to Build?

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kgultrt/SystemShellBox
   ```

2. Modify Gradle configuration:  
   Open the `gradle.properties` file in the project root and **delete the following line**:
   ```properties
   # ‰∏ìÈó®ÁÆ°ÁéØÂ¢ÉËÆæÁΩÆÔºåËØ∑Âà†Èô§Ëøô‰∏ÄË°å
   android.aapt2FromMavenOverride=/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.androidide/aapt2
   ```

   Also delete the `local.properties` file.

3. Build using Android Studio or command line (do NOT use b.sh):
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

## FAQ
1. Why so many auto-commits?

This is a result of using b.sh. Rest assured, future commits will have proper messages.

2. Why do some committers lack GitHub avatars?

This was due to a git configuration issue and will not happen again.

3. I want a new feature!

Please open an Issue to request features. I'll review them.
